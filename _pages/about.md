  <p style="font-size: 1.2em; color: #555;">Researcher in Computer Vision</p>
</div>

I am a self-motivated and ambitious student at Communication University of China, focused on computer vision research. I am committed to producing high-quality work. I am currently an undergraduate student at School of Information and Communication Engineering and a member of MIPG (Multimedia Intelligent Processing Group).

My research focuses on two primary areas:
* **Deep Generative Models**: I work on diffusion models and autoregressive models, with a focus on controllable generation and editing. I'm particularly interested in transformer-based architectures like DiT and developing video generation techniques aligned with physical principles.
* **Large Language Models**: My research includes LLM alignment and efficient fine-tuning approaches, especially LoRA-based techniques for personalized model customization while maintaining alignment with human values.

[Exploring Kolmogorov-Arnold networks for realistic image sharpness assessment](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10890447)

[[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07762) | [[Code]](https://github.com/CUC-Chen/KAN4IQA) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='10890447'></span></strong>
- This paper is the first to apply Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to image quality assessment.
- We introduce a novel Taylor series-based KAN (TaylorKAN) that models complex nonlinear relationships between image features and quality scores.
- Extensive experiments on four databases (BID2011, CID2013, CLIVE, and KonIQ-10k) demonstrate that KANs outperform traditional methods.
