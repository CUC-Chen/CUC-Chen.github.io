[Exploring Kolmogorov-Arnold networks for realistic image sharpness assessment](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10890447)

Shaode Yu, ***Ze Chen***, Zhimu Yang, Jiacheng Gu, Bizu Feng, Qiurui Sun*

[Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10890447) | [Code](https://github.com/CUC-Chen/KAN4IQA) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='10890447'></span></strong>
- This paper is the first to apply Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to image quality assessment
- We introduce a novel Taylor series-based KAN (TaylorKAN) that models complex nonlinear relationships between image features and quality scores
- Extensive experiments on four databases (BID2011, CID2013, CLIVE, and KonIQ-10k) demonstrate that KANs outperform traditional methods

# üß† Research Interests

## Deep Generative Models
With the advancement of deep generative models, my research focus has shifted from U-Net based models to those built on DiT (Diffusion Transformer) architectures. I am committed to exploring token interactions in DiT and developing video generation techniques that align with real-world physical principles.

## Large Language Models
I am interested in exploring the current level of perception and understanding of the real world exhibited by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). At the same time, I am considering more rational and effective approaches to LoRA fine-tuning, particularly to enable personalized customization of these models.

## Probabilistic Modeling
Recently, flow matching has brought fresh ideas to generative modeling. My focus splits into two: advancing probabilistic modeling methods like DDPM and DDIM, which rely on the mathematics of SDEs and ODEs that I'm fascinated by, and designing novel model architectures by turning my brainstorm into real outcomes.
